# squasher-browser-extension

Extension to group browser tabs by URL domain into a new window.

*WARNING: This may be buggy, it's designed for my own personal use and is not polished for the general public.*

## Features

- Shows all open tabs grouped by domain
- Supports "The Marvelous Suspender" and groups tabs correctly by original URL domain
- Also creates a group for all `News` domains (e.g. `bloomberg.com`, `cnn.com`, etc.)
- Allows saving all tabs in group to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) (`P`)
- Allows closing all tabs in group with one click (`x`)
